I ran in this other issue in in France and it's uh okay it's a hideous story before I get into it it's about cheeseburgers so when I order cheeseburgers I just want bun cheese and meat is anyone else the same way I know okay we're very rare that people hate us for it but like every time the waiter comes to I'm like I just want cheese and like just cheese and like yes just cheese I don't understand lettuce as nothing to the conversation it's crunchy water and also I hate pickles I hey oh I oh pickles are nothing but cucumbers sitting in their own piss that's what a pickle is yes and if you ask for no pickles seven pickles will show up on your plate but I always ask boys I'm like just cheese just cheese just cheese they always make a fuss about it then when it comes your friends are like what are you a seventh grader I'm like you eat ass Shut the up let me eat my Burger so I always want just cheese so okay so I'm in Paris right and we're we're drunk and it's late and the only place open is and I was like let's get Mickey D's so we're standing in line and I asked my friend my friend the guy I'm sleeping with and I'm like how do I say just cheese in French and he's like okay so I walk up to the woman working there and she's like McDonald's and I was like bonsoir you would say on cheeseburger Avec Sol Monte fromage she stopped typing she looked at me and she goes fromage I'm like oh my God it's happening in another country right now
